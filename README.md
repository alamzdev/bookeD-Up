# bookeD-Up
My webapp (NextHacks Hackathon)
## Inspiration
Based in Edmonton, Canada, I noticed something interesting when I started school here. Many of my friends were diving into small businesses as a side hustleâ€”whether it was braiding and barbing hair, fixing nails, installing wigs, or even tutoring. They often managed appointments through text messages, which led to missed bookings, rescheduling, or even cancellations. To solve this problem and streamline their scheduling, I created a web app called bookeD-Up.

## What it does
The idea behind the app is like how a regular booking would work. So it allows for the business/store owners to manage their bookings using a unique code generated for their store. They are able to post this on social media and when customers visit the bookeD-Up website they can then copy the business code and use it to see the available time slots set by the owner and book an appointment appropriately.
It just offers a seamless booking experience for customers and managing experience for owners so they don't worry about missing a next appointment.

## How we built it
To bring this web app to life, I focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. HTML and CSS provided the foundational structure and visual design, ensuring a clean, appealing layout. JavaScript enhanced the functionality, managing alerts and handling form submissions to the backend. For the backend, I employed Python with the Flask framework. This setup allowed for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring smooth transitions between pages and effective data management for both business owners and customers.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was implementing the backend, which I am still working on. Translating the theoretical aspects into a functional backend proved more complex than anticipated. While I am more comfortable with frontend development, I initially definitely struggled with backend integration. I hoped to find a teammate to assist with this aspect but I couldn't get any. I pushed through with extensive research and trial and error to meet the 48-hour deadline. I am will continue to develop this once I learn the proper backend implementation using python.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of what I've achieved so far. This is my first hackathon, and turning my frontend knowledge into a working web app has been a rewarding experience. Completing this project solo was a significant milestone, demonstrating my growth and dedication. As an engineering student with a passion for coding, this project has further fueled my enthusiasm for programming

## What we learned
Over the course of 48 hours, I gained valuable insights into full-stack development, including client-server interactions and database management. I also learned how to handle form inputs and connect frontend elements with the backend. Additionally, I delved into color theory and explored Python frameworks and libraries, enriching my overall skill set.

## What's next for bookeD-Up Website
I am committed to bringing my idea to life and have a clear plan for its development. My next steps include enhancing the user interface, potentially using React to create a more dynamic and visually appealing frontend. I'll integrate Google OAuth2 for seamless sign-ups and logins. On the backend, I'll focus on ensuring that business information is securely stored and quickly retrievable. All functionalities will be thoroughly tested to guarantee a smooth user experience. As the app gains traction, I plan to introduce premium features for businesses and explore monetization through advertisements.
